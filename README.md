# C2IT
C2IT ("See to IT") supports planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling IT infrastructure.

The C2IT model software analyser should answer the question: if we like to do this (entity), which will result in this capacity (consumable) need for a performer, can this be supplied and if not, in what element is the (root)problem located?

## Command and Control (C2) with C2IT

C2IT stands for Command and Control for IT Infrastructure, utilizing the key principles of Command and Control strategies, where decision-making is centralized and instructions flow from the top down. C2IT extends its application beyond the typical boundaries of an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, offering configuration-as-code capabilities that keep your configuration perpetually at the desired state.

The name "C2IT" is also a clever reference to "See to IT", highlighting the tool's ability to autonomously maintain the health of your IT infrastructure. It does not merely deploy infrastructure; instead, it goes a step further to ensure that your setup remains consistent with your configuration over time.

To achieve this, C2IT employs an OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop-based approach that enables it to continuously monitor the existing infrastructure, update the Operational Picture, make decisions based on current circumstances, and carry out actions to align the state with the desired configuration. This process allows C2IT to "See to IT" that your infrastructure remains at its desired state over time.

With C2IT, you get a tool that not only sets up your infrastructure but also takes proactive steps to ensure it continually meets your specifications, effortlessly handling the evolution and complexities of modern IT infrastructure.

## C2IT Program - OODA Concept and the Operational Picture

The C2IT program operates on the principles of the OODA loop, a concept developed by military strategist John Boyd. OODA stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act and is a methodology that is designed to allow an individual or a team to react to an evolving situation in an effective and efficient manner.

In the context of the C2IT program, we use the OODA loop as the core of our operations.

### OODA Explained

- Observe: The first part of the loop involves data collection. This might be monitoring metrics, taking customer input, sailing data or any other kinds of observations related to the mission.

- Orient: Next, the information that has been gathered is processed and understood in context.

- Decide: Based on the orientation process, decision-making happens. Depending on the data received and the context of the situation, different decisions might be made using the same observed data.

- Act: Finally, the decided plan is carried out. After the action, the loop starts over by observing the effect of the action, furthering understanding the situation and informing the next cycle through the OODA loop.

This loop continues around continuously, with the subsequent iterations further refining the actions taken based on updated observations.

### Operational Picture (OP)

A key feature in our implementation of the OODA loop in the C2IT program is the use of an Operational Picture (OP).

The OP is a constantly updating picture of the state of the operations. It is updated in real-time with the latest data from the four OODA processes, allowing for all users to stay updated with the current situation.

Specifically, each stage of the OODA loop updates the OP with its data in real-time. The OP can be viewed as a 'live report' of the OODA's findings and actions, summarizing the actions of the software at any given moment. The decisions and actions taken by the program are all informed by the current state of the OP.

Overall, the OP helps keep all OODA steps aligned and ensures decisions and actions are based on the most recent data.

In conclusion, the C2IT program using an OODA architecture and an OP represents a dynamic and responsive system that quickly adjusts to new information and conditions, providing a robust strategy for data-driven decision making.

## Enterprise Architecture with ArchiMate and C2IT

A key prerequisite to effective application of C2IT to maintain your IT infrastructure is a detailed and well-defined Enterprise Architecture. It is essential to clearly delineate the desired configuration and state of your infrastructure. To this end, C2IT utilizes the ArchiMate enterprise architectural framework.

ArchiMate provides a structured and uniform language for describing, analyzing, and visualizing the various domains of enterprise architecture. It plays a crucial role in defining the knowledge C2IT uses to make decisions and take actions on your IT infrastructure within the OODA loop.

By integrating ArchiMate with our core OODA methodology and configuration-as-code approach, C2IT ensures a comprehensive and consistent understanding of your IT infrastructure. It allows the tool to respond efficiently to changes, and maintain your environment congruent with your enterprise architectural vision.

With C2IT, you'll be leveraging the power of enterprise architecture and command and control, encapsulated in a tool that actively "sees to IT" that your infrastructure is not only deployed, but also maintained at the desired state.
